# hayro

An experimental, work-in-progress PDF rasterizer.

In its current state, it is probably the most comprehensive implementation of a PDF rasterizer in pure Rust,
but it still lacks a lot of features and has many issues. The codebase is also in dire need of a cleanup and documentation.

A demo tool can be found at https://laurenzv.github.io/hayro/. Note that embedded JPEG2000 images are not supported
in the web version.
