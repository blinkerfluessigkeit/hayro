# hayro-render

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

A crate for rendering PDF files.

This crate allows you to render PDF files into a pixmap. For more information on how to
use this crate, see the [example](https://github.com/LaurenzV/hayro/tree/master/hayro/examples) in
the GitHub repository.

This crate is still very much in development, because of this, documentation is currently still
very lacking.

### Cargo features
This crate has one feature, `jpeg2000`. See the description of
[`hayro-syntax`](https://docs.rs/hayro-syntax/latest/hayro_syntax/#cargo-features) for more information.
